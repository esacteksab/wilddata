# Barry and Dave's Artifact-Tracking Index Of Doom
We'll figure out a pithy description soon.

## Setup

- Clone this repository.
- Set up sentry DSN? (help, no idea what that is but we can't fly without it)
- `make build`
- `bin/wtfizit`

## Testing (sort of)

You can use a VSCode extension called [rest-client](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client). The `.http` files are located in `REST_API_TEST` directory. This makes it a little easier to do a `GET` or a `POST` and it's possible to share.

## Core features to build (high-level)


## TODO


## DONE
